            The SAS3000 project made me realize that technical skills are just one part of the equation for career success. While honing my communication, teamwork, and interview skills is essential, my experiences—from creating a cartoon about programming to transitioning into game development—taught me that passion and drive are key to achieving objectives. My academic journey, marked by fluctuations from being a top performer to falling below average and then climbing back to the top, showed me the significance of persistence and grit. These lessons have deeply shaped my self-discovery and approach to challenges.

Working with organizations like Harvard MUN and the Peer Tutor Society as a web development staff member further shaped my professional growth. These roles allowed me to develop not only technical expertise but also crucial interpersonal skills, such as leadership, collaboration, and adaptability. These experiences continue to influence my values, attitudes, and approach toward pursuing a career in software engineering, giving me confidence and reinforcing the importance of lifelong learning.

Despite these advancements, I recognize areas for improvement, particularly in public speaking. Over the next few months, I plan to work on presenting ideas without prior preparation and seize opportunities to speak publicly. Additionally, I want to strengthen my adaptability to better prepare for the challenges in the ever-evolving tech industry. To achieve this, I am committed to seeking internships, certifications, and mentorships that will support my development as an exceptional software engineer.

Ultimately, I envision a career in software engineering not just as a means to satisfy my own aspirations, but also as an opportunity to create positive change in society. My professional growth has instilled in me a desire to help others by sharing my knowledge and training them, thus contributing to the advancement of the tech industry. I believe that improving myself—both technically and personally—will not only shape my career plans but also inspire and empower others in their professional journeys.

        <h1 className="text-4xl font-extrabold mt-8">PCK Results</h1>
        <p className="leading-10 text-justify">My career goals in SAS2000 were also centered around software engineering, as the PCK results of that year directed me towards structured and investigative fields, which I have always admired. While I recognize that these evaluations do not encompass the fullness of my character, they do tell me some very important things about a substantial aspect of who I am. They remind me of my ability to do complex tasks and my tendency for roles that require critical thinking and creativity. To a large extent, these findings validate and reinforce my career aspirations, strengthening my resolve to pursue a path in software engineering and to grow further in both technical expertise and personal development.</p>
